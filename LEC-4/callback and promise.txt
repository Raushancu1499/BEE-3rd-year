callback and inversion of control

to handle asynchronous operations we use callback

function purchaseProduct(Product-name){
    //do some asynchronous 
    I/O operations
    1) get product data from db 
    2) write order data on user 

}
purchaseProduct("iphone 16");

console.log("product purchased "); //runs first 

purchased product("iphone 16",function()){
    console.log("product is purchased");
}


ERROR FIRST CALLBACK 
- first argument
